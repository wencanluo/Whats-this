# README - Whats-this#

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.


### How do I get set up? ###

* The project is targeted at Android SDK level 9 (i.e. Android 2.3 Gingerbread) or higher.
* The project has been compiled and tested on Android SDK level 19 (i.e. Android 4.4.2 Kitkat)
* Please use Eclipse and Android ADT to compile.
* This project depends on Android SDK "v7 appcompat library" to compile. Please import the v7 appcompact library as a seperate project before you compile the main project. Please refer to The "Adding libraries with resources" section of the URL below https://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/setup.html .
* The current Whats-this Android app talks with the backend hosted on http://www.parse.com via REST API. Please create an account on parse.com and send wencanluo.cn@gmail.com an email to let him give you access to the administrative backend. 
* Please create a .gitignore file under the main directory to reduce upload traffic. You may copy and paste the contents from this location https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Android.gitignore .
